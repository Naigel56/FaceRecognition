# Face Recognition

This is a legacy university project (2011) meant to test the potential and performances of an android application implementing face recognition through the openCV library.
It's now outdated due to the availability of more performing new libraries, and also the results are to be considered an historical view, considering the computational power at disposal of modern smartphones.
